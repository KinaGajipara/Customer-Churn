# Customer-Churn

This project focuses on predicting customer churn by analyzing customer characteristics and product usage patterns to support retention strategies. Churn, or customer non-renewal, is a critical issue impacting business growth and cash flow, making it essential to identify factors driving customer behavior. The work involves data cleaning, visualization, and model development to create a predictive tool for identifying high-risk customers, ultimately guiding effective retention and loyalty initiatives.

Project Overview:
1. Data Exploration & Feature Engineering: Perform data preprocessing and EDA to identify key patterns.
2. Hypothesis Testing: Use Chi-square tests to evaluate feature importance and significance in relation to churn.
3. Machine Learning Modeling: Test multiple algorithms to accurately classify customers likely to churn.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. Insights & Recommendations: Offer business-focused strategies to reduce churn based on model predictions.

Model tested:
logistic regression, decision tree, Random forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting

Evaluation:
radient Boosting was found to have the best overall performance, achieving the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC, followed closely by Random Forest and SVM.

Business Recommendations: 
Targeted Retention Campaigns, Enhanced Customer Experience, Regularly monitor churn predictions and customer feedback, Optimized Marketing, Investment in Predictive Tools,
Customer Education and Engagement.
