Developed a predictive model for customer churn by analyzing customer characteristics and product usage patterns, utilizing machine learning algorithms (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVM) to classify high-risk
customers. Conducted data exploration, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing to enhance model accuracy, generating insights that helped decrease churn rates and supported targeted retention strategies to
improve customer loyalty.
